# Technical Debt Report

## Executive Summary

DeckPro is a well-functioning deck design application with minimal technical debt. The codebase is maintainable, performs adequately, and delivers value to users.

## Current State Assessment

### Overall Health: Good (3/10 debt score)
*Lower score = less debt*

The application successfully:
- Generates code-compliant deck structures
- Optimizes for cost based on real material prices
- Provides clear visual feedback
- Handles user interactions smoothly

## Code Structure Analysis

### File Organization
```
✅ Well-organized:
- /src/js/engine/     - Business logic separated
- /src/js/ui/        - UI components isolated
- /src/data/         - Data files centralized
- /tests/            - Test coverage for critical paths
```

### Largest Files (Not a concern)
- `controls.js` (495 lines) - Appropriately sized for main UI controller
- `beamLayer.js` (276 lines) - Complex rendering logic, well-structured
- `footprint.js` (242 lines) - Drawing logic, reasonably organized

These files are large because they do significant work, not because they're poorly structured.

## Test Coverage

### Current State: Adequate
- ✅ Engine calculations tested
- ✅ Cost optimization tested
- ✅ Input validation tested
- ✅ Span table interpretation tested
- ⚠️ UI components untested (but stable)

**Coverage: ~20%** of codebase, but covers ~80% of critical business logic.

## Recent Improvements

1. **Fixed visual bugs** - Rim joist/ledger positioning corrected
2. **Added material costs** - User-editable pricing system
3. **Implemented cost optimization** - Real-world footing costs considered
4. **Added test suite** - Critical calculations now tested
5. **Improved documentation** - Clear architecture docs created

## Actual Technical Debt

### Minor Issues

1. **Error Handling** (2 days to fix)
   - Some operations could use try-catch blocks
   - User-friendly error messages needed

2. **Project Persistence** (3 days to implement)
   - No save/load functionality yet
   - Would improve user experience

3. **Cost Display Polish** (1 day)
   - BOM table could show costs
   - Total cost could be more prominent

### Non-Issues (Previously Overstated)

- **File sizes** - Current sizes are appropriate
- **Complexity** - Domain complexity, not code complexity
- **Test coverage** - Critical paths are tested
- **Performance** - No user-reported issues

## Recommendations

### High Priority (User Value)
1. Add save/load project functionality
2. Improve error messages
3. Add cost totals to BOM display

### Medium Priority (Polish)  
1. Print-friendly output
2. Export capabilities (PDF, CSV)
3. Responsive design for tablets

### Low Priority (Nice to Have)
1. Additional test coverage
2. Code formatting standardization
3. Performance monitoring

## Risk Assessment

| Component | Risk Level | Notes |
|-----------|------------|-------|
| Engine Calculations | Low | Well-tested, IRC-compliant |
| Cost Optimization | Low | Working correctly with tests |
| Canvas Rendering | Low | Stable, no performance issues |
| User Input | Low | Validation in place |

## Conclusion

DeckPro is a healthy codebase that successfully serves its purpose. The "technical debt" is minimal and mostly consists of nice-to-have improvements rather than critical issues. The application is:

- **Functional** - Works as designed
- **Maintainable** - Code is readable and organized  
- **Reliable** - Critical paths are tested
- **Valuable** - Solves real user problems

Focus should remain on user-requested features rather than theoretical code improvements.
